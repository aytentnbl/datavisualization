## How the Pandemic Changed Our Understanding of Entertainment: 
**A LOOK AT THE SITUATION THROUGH TWITCH STATISTICS**
<br> <br/> *Introduction* <br/> <br>
  In this study, I observed the situation using the data of the entertainment website twitch.tv to inform people how our understanding of entertainment has changed.Our understanding of entertainment has changed during the pandemic , it has turned to mobile devices and entertainment applications .The fact that people are confined to their homes and have limited opportunities has led to this situation.Twitch.tv has managed to turn the situation in its favor by offering an environment where people can have fun, follow politics closely, attend concerts, and have a good time with their friends. 
  
  ### Why Twitch ?
  <br/>
   I wanted to see if our understanding of entertainment had changed. Finding open and accessible data in the series, film industry and game industry could be very challenging for me, but since I have a broadcasting acquaintance, I knew that Twitch already offers instant viewership, weekly daily data, even to small publishers. Therefore, it would be much easier for me to observe how this site, which has a much more open source, has changed during the pandemic. It was very easy for me to access the dataset,from a website that keeps twitch logs.
   
   ### Goal of the Project
   <br/>
    In my project, I wanted to explain the growth rate of this website, which can be considered as the new entertainment trend, the audience of the site, the advertisements it receives, which categories are watched and how much, so I used very understandable and clear graphs by appealing to the general audience and to inform people about it.I examined the change in people's understanding of entertainment by the scope of the Twitch.tv. <br/>
